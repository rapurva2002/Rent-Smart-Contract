A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally-relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need for trusted intermediators, arbitration costs, and fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. 

This is a smart contract to help with Rent Management. The functionalities include creating accounts, booking rooms, checking availability among others.
